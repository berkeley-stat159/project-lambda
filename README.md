# Fall 2015 - Project Lambda
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/berkeley-stat159/project-lambda.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/berkeley-stat159/project-lambda?branch=master)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/berkeley-stat159/project-lambda/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/berkeley-stat159/project-lambda?branch=master)

## Overview
This project reproduces a subset of the analysis conducted in *A High-Resolution 7-Tesla fMRI Dataset from Complex Natural Stimulation with an Audio Movie*by Hanke et al. We analyze inter-subject correlation among 5 subjects, then apply machine learning to see if we can predict if a subject was
listening to an interior or exterior scene of the movie based on brain state. The results for our reproduction are consistent with those produced by Hanke et al. and our internal-external scene classifier has a validation accuracy of 0.942.


## System requirements
### Storage
The raw data is approximately 37.5 GBs. Additionally, the complete analysis will - in total - produce another approximately 190 GBs of data written to disk. Please ensure your machine is equippted with sufficient storage space. 
### Memory
Since large matrices must be computed and held in memory, systems should have at least 90 GBs of accessible RAM. **We strongly encourage running on a machine with 120 GBs of accessible RAM to emulate development environment.** 


## Installation
1. Clone and move into the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/berkeley-stat159/project-lambda.git && cd project-lambda`
2. Install python dependencies with pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Code depends on an internally provided python module module called `stat159lambda`. Ensure this module is on your python path with `export PYTHONPATH='<absolute-path-to-repository>/project-lambda/code'`.  
For example, `export PYTHONPATH='/Users/alondaks/project-lambda/code'`. We strongly encourage adding your export statement to your `.bashrc` while running this project to ensure the environement variable is defined in all shells. 


## Running tests
To run python unit tests: `make test` from the top level project directory.


## How to run code and analysis
Please run the follow make commands in order from top to bottom from within the top level project directory.  

1. Download and verify data    
  - `make download-data` fetches and downloads raw data  
  - `make validate-data` verifies data integrity against known checksums  
2. Preprocess the data 
  - `make preprocess` concatenates runs, applies guassian filter, and reshapes data to 2d 
3. Exploratory data analysis 
  - `make eda` produces eda plots and simulations 
4. Reproduction 
  - `make reproduction` runs all correlation reproduction work and produces analysis figures 
5. Classification 
  - `make classification-cross-validate` runs random forrest cross validation and saves cv accuracies to file 
  - `make classification-validation` tests a fully trained random forrest on validation set and saves accuracy to file 

To run all analysis excluding data download and verification (steps 2-5 only): `make all-analysis`

## How to generate report PDF
To generate the PDF report run `make generate-paper` from the top level project directory. To remove remove intermediary latex files run `make clean-paper`
